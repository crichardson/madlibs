// Here is an example. You should probably delete it.

// First, we'll ask the user what their name is.
var userName = prompt("What is your name?");

// You'll probably want to ask all your questions first.
// Then, we'll write it onto the page.
document.write("Hello, " + userName + "!");

// That's pretty much it.
